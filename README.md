## Stage 1 â€“ Static Skeleton

This is the initial skeleton of the **Timeline App**, created using semantic HTML5 structure.

### Features in Stage 1:

- A `<header>` with a title/logo and a theme toggle button
- An empty `<nav>` for future filters or navigation controls
- A `<section id="timeline">` as a placeholder for timeline event markers
- A `<div id="modal">` for pop-up modals (future stages)
- Semantic layout using `<main>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, and others

This version focuses only on layout and does not include dynamic functionality. Future stages will implement JavaScript features and timeline interactions.
